# â›” Antivirus Warnings

The YARC Launcher may get some antivirus warnings from Windows Defender, along with other antiviruses. The main reason for this is that we are not certified with Microsoft, which immediately deems the program suspicious in some antiviruses. As this application increases in popularity, some antiviruses may start to trust the launcher more, and in which case, no issues will be found.

If you don't trust us for whatever reason, the source code for the launcher is above, and you can see instructions on how to build the launcher below. Apologies for the inconvenience!
